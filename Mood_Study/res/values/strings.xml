    <string name="instructions">In this game, you can roll a die for monetary prizes. The game is really simple. On each play, we will tell you a winning number and ask you to touch the prize that goes with that number on the touch screen. This is so that we can be sure you know which prize is at stake. Then we will ask you to roll a single fair die.  If you roll the winning number, you will win the prize; if you don\’t roll the winning number, you will be offered another play. In this game, the prizes are as follows: you will win 10p if you roll a \'1\' (when we asked for a \'1\'); 20p if you roll a \'2\' (when we asked for a \'2\'; and so on…so 30p if you roll a \'3\'; 40p if you roll a \'4\'; 50p if you roll a \'5\' and 60p if you roll a \'6\' The die in the game is fair and the outcomes of each play are random. You can play the game just once and you must play to the end if you want to the total value of your prizes to be added to your experiment fee.</string>
